# CExact
A c header for abstracting some mathematical concepts to do exact math

## Features

### Equation Elements
- variables: unknown values that can be substituted as literals
- fractions: integer divided by integer fractions, without the stress of floating-point rounding
- radicals: fractional powers, again, without the worry that things won't cancel out perfectly
- trigonometric functions: good approximations for trig functions as well as exact representations

### Equation Manipulation
- calculus: derivatives and antiderivatives will be available, as well as definite integrals
- simplifying: factoring, mathematical identities, distribution, and more will be available
- dimensional analysis: changing units from one-another, useful in scientific circumstances
